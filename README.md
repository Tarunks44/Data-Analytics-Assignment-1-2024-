1. Run the Girvan-Newman Algorithm on these data sets.
2. Come up with an automated algorithm to determine the right set of communities using the Girvan-Newman method. What would be your
stopping criterion?
3. Visualise the resulting dendrogram to come up with an appropriate stopping criterion.
4. Do the same for the Louvain algorithm. Show the communities you get
after one iteration.
5. How would you pick the best decomposition of nodes into communities?
6. What was the running time of the Girvan-Newman algorithm versus
the Louvain algorithm on the data sets you were given?
7. In your opinion which algorithm gave rise to better communities, and why?
